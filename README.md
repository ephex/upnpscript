UPnPscript
===

Scripts to set and delete port mappings using upnpc, a script provided by the MiniUPnP utility (http://miniupnp.free.fr/).

Usage:

setport <portnum>

  outputs some stuff and somewhere in there shows you the random high port your port maps to publicly.

delport <portnum>

  deletes the port mapping and outputs a bunch more unpnc status stuff.
